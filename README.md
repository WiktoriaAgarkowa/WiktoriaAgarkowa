## Hi, I'm Vika :v:

:octocat: I have been working as a graphic designer for three years. I mainly designed outdoor and print advertising and sometimes drawn illustrations. 
In early 2020 I decided to change my life and expand my abilities, so I started learning programming languages. 

:zap: Now I'm focused on learning React and at the same time practice my JavaScript skills every day.

:heart: I truly believe that the highest goal of any activity is to do something good and useful for others.
